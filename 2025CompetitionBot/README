This is how to set up the robot if you are a subteam or someone who wants to know how to set it up

1. get a mentor who knows what they are doing


# START #
First, go to github and pull the origin (aka, click the blue button until it stops showing up)
You should be past this step

Next if your already in vscode and reading this good job!
otherwise open 2025 wpilib vscode

# turning the robot on #
if the robot is not on look for the optifuse waterproof (it should be on the edge)
push the switch into the cover
to turn it off press the button on top of the optifuse
lights and sounds should be happening
check if there is a usb plugged into the robot otherwise it will yell at you for not having enough storage

# Actually doing stuff with the robot #
Grab a controller, it should be in or on top of the cart
set the wifi to the 4917 robot or 4917_practice (whichever one you're using)
open up the frc driver station
get the deploy sword
press the 3 dots in the top right of vscode
hit deploy
after the build is done then press enable
get ready to press enter or space if something goes wrong

# Driving the robot #
left joystick moves it
right joystick turns it
dont press anything else unless you know what it does
